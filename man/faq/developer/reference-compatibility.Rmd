vctrs provides a framework for working with vector classes in a generic way. However, it implements several compatibility fallbacks to base R methods. In this reference you will find how vctrs tries to be compatible with your vector class, and what base methods you need to implement for compatibility.


## The vctrs primitives

Most functions in vctrs are aggregate operations: they call other vctrs functions which themselves call other vctrs functions. The dependencies of a vctrs functions are listed in the Dependencies section of its documentation page. Take a look at [vec_count()] for an example.

These dependencies form a tree whose roots are the four vctrs primitives.


### The proxy and restoration generics

- [vec_proxy()]
- [vec_restore()]

These generics are essential for vctrs but mostly optional. `vec_proxy()` defaults to an [identity][identity] function and you normally don't need to implement it. The proxy a vector must be one of the atomic vector types, a list, or a data frame. By default, S3 lists that do not inherit from `"list"` do not have an identity proxy. In that case, you need to explicitly implement `vec_proxy()` or make your class inherit from list.

`vec_restore()` is called is called after manipulating vector proxies, to restore attributes that might have been lost in the process or that need to be updated when the contents of a vector have changed. If not implemented, all attributes are restored by default.


### The coercion generics

The coercion mechanism in vctrs is based on two generics:

- [vec_ptype2()]
- [vec_cast()]

See the [theory overview][theory-faq-coercion].

Two objects with the same class and the same attributes are always considered compatible by ptype2 and cast. If the attributes or classes differ, they throw an incompatible type error.

Coercion errors are the main source of incompatibility with vctrs. See the [howto guide][howto-faq-coercion] if you need to implement methods for these generics.


## Aggregate operations with fallbacks

vctrs can achieve all necessary operations on vectors with the four primitives listed boved. However there are many higher level operations. The most important ones implement fallbacks to base generics for maximum compatibility with existing classes.

- We have started to implement a fallback mechanism in [vec_cast_common()]. This function normally calls [vec_ptype2()] and [vec_cast()] to normalise a set of inputs to the same type. When the inputs do not implement the coercion generics but they all inherit from the same base class, we do not attempt any coercion and leave the inputs as is.

  This fallback should be safe to use before operations like [vec_match()] or [vec_rbind()]. It is currently internal.

- [vec_slice()] falls back to the base `[` generic if no [vec_proxy()] method is implemented. This way foreign classes  that do not implement [vec_restore()] can restore attributes based on the new subsetted contents.

- [vec_c()] falls back to `base::c()` if all inputs have the same class for which a `c()` method is implemented but no self-to-self [vec_ptype2()] method is implemented.
